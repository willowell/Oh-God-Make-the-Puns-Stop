!!! Bug
//TODO: Entering only one digit where two are possible causes the program to bug out:

    Please enter the number of tickets you wish to purchase.
    1
    Please enter only one double digit number!
    01
    Would you like to manually reserve the seats? [y/n]
    Otherwise, the program will ask if you want to log your request.

    y
    Please enter the row number for the 1 seat that you want to purchase.
    9
    Please enter only one double digit number!
    09
    Please enter the seat number for the 1 seat that you want to purchase.
    09
    Unable to reserve seat.

    Returning to the main menu.

    The source of this bug is therefore in:

    short int validate_string_as_double_digit_integer_in_range( std::string buffer, short int min, short int max ) {}

    The function needs to be modified to allow one digit as well as two.

2019 Dec 13: Fixed by changing the buffer length check.


!!! Bug
//TODO: Auditorium display does not reflect changes to the state of the seats.
    Steps: Reserve a seat
    Re-display the auditorium in which the seat was reserved.

    Resetting the auditorium works fine; the display reflects it accordingly.
    So, the problem is probably in how I am reserving seats.

    Additionally, there seems to be an offset problem: (x, y) = (9, 9) becomes (9, 8).
    Likewise, (x, y) = (1, 1) becomes (1, 0).

    So, something about how I am using row_num (y) is not working.

    The problem is in Auditorium::load_from_file in Auditorium.cpp:

        i++;
        num_rows = i;

    i++; here causes the first row to be 1 rather than 0.

    That fixed the problem :-)


Notes:
	2019 Dec 10
	I have considered some ways to approach exchanging global variables for local variables, and I have made
	a few observations:
		• Files that hold global state or external state, such as the files, the auditoriums, and the single Theatre
		  object, cannot be exchanged for local variables without passing each into most of the functions in Utilities as
		  a const ref, which means the functions are now more complicated.
		• Creating an auditorium array may help with the functions where I'm doing the same function over and over again.
			-> This could simplify the switch statements from earlier.
			   However, then I would have to deal with the overhead of keeping track of how many auditoriums there are.
			   Right now, there are only three, and I am idealizing an indie movie theatre which has only three auditoriums.
			   So, it wouldn't make much sense to make it easier to add more.
			-> This would not simplify saving data to the Theatre object.
				
				theatre.set_total_seats(
					auditorium_1.get_total_seats() +
					auditorium_2.get_total_seats() +
					auditorium_3.get_total_seats()
				);
				
				This is simpler than using a for-loop for now, and does not incur the overhead of a for-loop or foreach (iterator) loop.
				
		• The variables under User Input are the best candidates for localization. However, variables
		  that are local to the main program loop, such as user_wants_to_quit, have the same problem:
		  factoring them out means they will have to be passed in by-ref to the function instead.
		  
		• It will be more obvious that the function is operating on global data, but my intention here
		  is that these functions represent phases of the main program loop, rather than independent functions.
		  So, while these functions are operating on global data, I have no intention of these functions ever being reusable
		  because they are particular to the lifecycle of this program, much like how GameObjects work with Unity3D's main update loop.
